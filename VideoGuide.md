#Training and Enablement Video Guide
Use this guide when creating videos for enablement. It is designed as a template with room for creativity. The goal is to provide a unified experience for users as they navigate hours of content.
 
##Technical Setup
###Preparing an outline
*  Prepare a written outline that explicitly states the learning objectives
*  Include the “chapters” or subtopics you will discuss
*  Submit this outline with the raw video when you are done

###Screen recording
*  Tools for this include QuickTime, SnagIt, ScreenFlow, Jing, and Camtasia
*  Do a short practice run and review the recording before launching into your full demo
*  Record only screens that have high resolution and clear text and images
*  Use a higher contrast mode, a readable font, and increase font and application size
*  If you add animations, be sure they add to content and are not distracting 
*  Set up all necessary tools and install necessary applications before you run a demo

###Audio recording
*  Better quality audio will come from a dedicated microphone, not your laptop mic
*  Screen recording tools will have audio monitors so you can see the quality as you record
*  Do a test recording and listen for echo, clipping, excessive noise, and background noise [blog with tips]
*  Avoid cliches, idioms, and foul language as well as mumbling and complaining
*  Speak naturally--this is how the listener will get to know you, so it is nice to hear a person and not a robot voice
*  It is often helpful to record your screen and then record your audio as you watch your recording
*  Do as many takes as you need; audio can always be edited

###Presenting a demo
*  If using BlueJeans, be sure your connection is good before starting
*  Increase text size and contrast so it will be easily readable
*  Start any time intensive processes ahead of time, if possible
 
##Format
Each video should have the following:

###Introduction to the learning objectives for the video
This should be the first thing learners hear/see. It should be short and clear. If not, it might be a good idea to examine what the goal of your video really is and if it needs to be simplified or rethought.

**Examples:**
>This video will teach you how to download and deploy learning VMs to teach Puppet courses.

>In this demo, you will learn how to use code manager to…

>After watching this, you will be able to deploy PE across 10,000 nodes.

###Learning checkpoints
For longer or more complex videos, give the user some clear checkpoints. Pause and summarize what they have learned so far. Be sure to repeat core concepts and vocabulary throughout the video. Use consistent language and include only what is needed for the lesson.

**Examples:**
>By now, you have seen how to clone the training repo and use rake commands to get your classroom ready. Remember you can go back and review this content at any time. 

>So far, you have learned the basics of Hiera 5 and how it is different than previous versions. If you need additional help with these, review lesson one.

###Clear conclusion with summary and any next steps
At the end of each video, be sure to tell the user what they need to do and what they have just done. This is especially important for videos that cover sequential processes.

**Examples:**
>You are now ready to set up your virtual classroom. In the next module, you will learn how to keep your students engaged while online.

>This video showed you how to deploy PE on a monolithic master and connect agents. Now you are able to complete 2 of the 3 steps in a jumpstart.
